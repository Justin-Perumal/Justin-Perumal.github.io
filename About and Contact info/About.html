                        Hey! My name is Jake and welcome to my blogsite! If youre here it means you might want to know a bit more about me. Well to start off with let me tell you some of the basics. I consider myself to be quite friendly and outgoing... maybe a bit too much initially (^^")  I love cooking and the occasional meme, combine the two and we will get along just fine :D

                        I mentioned I love cooking well thats most likely because I am a profesionally trained chef who is currently working in Johannesburg, South Africa. I have been cooking almost all my life so it was a no brainer. Eventually I would like to open my own restaurant and hey, if you come to my future establishment and show this blog. I may just give you a discount ;) For now you can just check out my Instagram (link to be added) to see what I'm up to!

                        Being a chef is all good but I do have some background in Computer Science as I studied a bit of it in university. This gave me an interest in tech and development, specifically related to web development, so I often read up on topics relating to this, and would love to share my thoughts when something interesting comes up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope you enjoy what I have to offer and look forward to some engaging content from cooking gadgets to my thoughts on the web and development! Seeya later :D
