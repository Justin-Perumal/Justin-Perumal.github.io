                    <h1>Character Blog 1: Sous Vide</h1>
                    <p>
                        I have exciting news to share! Recently our test kitchen at work acquired a new piece of equipment that has been creating a lot of buzz in the culinary world. We got our hands on a new Sous Vide machine! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For those of you who don’t know, Sous Vide is a cooking technique that utilizes precise temperature control to provide consistent, and quality cooking results every time. Sous Vide allows us to create dishes to the exact doneness we require, and at a restaurant consistency is extremely important. Not only does it allow for consistent results but allows the food to be cooked with as much flavour as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Sous Vide machine is placed in a body of water large enough for what you want to cook. Once in and turned on, the machine will make that body of water to the desired temperature you set before hand and ensures it remains at that temperature no matter what.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How does Sous Vide work? Well, it is extremely simple really. By keeping the temperature constant, there are no external factors that can affect the cook such as cold spots on a pan or the heat varying at specific points of your oven. The food is also cooked in its own juices ensuring none of that flavour is lost during the process. To give a real example, I’ll explain how to Sous Vide cook a steak using a recipe from <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/03/sous-vide-steaks-recipe.html">seriosueats.com</a>>:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Set your Sous Vide to the desired temperature in the water bath, which can be found online depending on the cut of steak and its thickness etc. (can also find the temperature for anything else you may want to cook).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Season your steak generously with salt and pepper, put it in a Sous Vide bag (or any vacuum sealable bag) along with some thyme, garlic and butter. Vacuum seal the bag and gently lower in the water bath.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            After around an hour (depending on the doneness you want) take bag out the water and remove the steak from it. Pat the steak dry and put a pan on the stove to heat up with a little oil or butter
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Sous Vide does not add colour unfortunately so to finish off, once the pan is searingly hot, add the steak to the pan. Since the steak is cooked perfectly, this sear is only done for around 20 seconds on each side or until the steak has that lovely brown colour associated with it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once the sear has been achieved, serve immediately!
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        The Sous Vide machine can be a little expensive, but its pros definitely make it worth the price. It used to be only high-end restaurants had access to the device but it’s now readily available for everyone if they want. I’m excited to experiment with it and see what’s possible. Depending on how that goes, expect an update soon with, I hope, exciting results!
