                        My perfect toasted cheese!
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes you get lazy to make a proper meal or you just want something quick and easy to make but is delicious nonetheless! For this my go to is a toasted cheese. It is easy, quick, and always hits the spot. The best part is you can customize your toasted cheese with flavours that you enjoy, I personally enjoy mine with a little bit of kimchi for that little extra flavour. Today I’m going to go through step by step so you too can enjoy!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Let's Begin:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Prepare your ingredients. This will be two slices of bread (per sandwich), some mayonnaise, butter, grated cheese of your choice (I use cheddar or gouda because that’s what generally is in my fridge), and for any other things you want to put in (kimchi for me!).
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                Heat your pan or skillet over a medium to low heat. I like to put a little bit of butter in to start melting at this point, this ensures no sticking.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                Where I deviate from traditional toasted sandwiches is the use of mayonnaise on the outside of the sandwich rather than butter. I find that it makes the sandwich more ‘toasty’. So spread a layer of mayonnaise on the outside of the sandwich and begin constructing the sandwich.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                To make the sandwich, put the grated cheese on the inside of the sandwich (as much as you want… just try not to overfill it). Afterwards place whatever else you would like on top. This isn’t necessary at all if you want a classic toasted cheese. Once done, place the second piece of bread on top and get ready to start toasting!
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                By now the pan should be heated enough and the butter should be foaming. Place the sandwich in the pan, mayo side down. Spread mayo on the top side and leave to toast for approximately 6-10 minutes until golden or to your desired level of toasty.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                Flip the sandwich and wait till the other side is toasted to perfection and the cheese is completely melted. Take out of pan and let it rest for a moment on a plate and cut in half.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                Repeat for as many toasted cheeses as you like!
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now that is how I make a toasted cheese. You may customise it as many ways as you like and make it completely your own. If you do decide to make one and post them on Instagram, tag me! I would love to see what you guys create and all the outcomes! ENJOY!!!
