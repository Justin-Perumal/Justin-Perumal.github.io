                    <h1>Character Blog 2: Kitchen Essentials</h1>
                    <p>
                        Hello everyone and welcome back to another blog! Some of you guys have been asking what I use to cook and where to begin when it comes to cooking. So, I thought I’d just give some insight on not necessarily where to begin in practice, but rather the tools that are essential in any kitchen whether you’re just starting out or have been cooking for a while and want to expand what you have available. Having the right tools at your disposal will not only make the experience easier, but you will grow accustomed to certain things much faster.

                            <li>
                                A good set of knives: This is undoubtedly the most important thing everyone needs in their kitchen. A good knife will make any food prep an ease and will allow you to make jobs like cutting vegetables or meat much easier if the knife is of quality. You only really need three knives in particular, a serrated knife; a long chef’s knife (20cm to 23cm or so); and a pairing knife (a smaller knife for more intricate things). This is where I recommend paying a bit more as a well-made knife will not only work better, but it will also last you for much longer.

                                A knife sharpener: Now that you have a good set of knives, you’ll need something to ensure those knives stay in good condition. It may take some time to get the hang of it (practice on cheaper knives first if you are unsure) but a sharpener with both coarse and fine grits will serve you well!
                            </li>

                                Cutting boards: I recommend you have two cutting boards, one used for meat and another for anything else. This will help ensure no harmful bacteria gets cross-contaminated between everything. For meats, a plastic board that will not slip during use is best and for produce and cooked food, a wooden board will be good enough!
                            </li>

                                Mixing bowls and measuring cups: It’s a good idea to have designated bowls that you will use when preparing food (for mixing, marinating, tossing etc). In conjunction, you will need a good variety of measuring cups to ensure accuracy when following recipes or adding specific ingredients to what you’re cooking.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Cookware (pots and pans): I recommend having at least one non-stick frying pan, especially if you’re a beginner. This pan will allow you to make majority of things without having to worry, but ensure you get some plastic or silicon utensils, so you don’t accidentally damage the pan. Also at least one or two pots (a saucepan and stockpot would be ideal) and this will cover almost everything you need.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                        There are plenty of other things that you can get that would make your life easier or fulfil different roles in the kitchen. However, this is just a small list of what you should have at least. As you evolve and progress, so too will the tools at your disposal.
