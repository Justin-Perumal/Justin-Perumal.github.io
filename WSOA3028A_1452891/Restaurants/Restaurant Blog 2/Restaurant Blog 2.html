                    Living in Johannesburg, we lack something that other cities have to offer. Most holidays people will travel extremely far (when we can travel again due to the pandemic) just to see it. If you haven’t guessed already, I’m talking about the beach. That feeling of seeing the ocean or feeling the sand beneath your feet is one that can’t be replaced. However, if you don’t want to travel so far and want to emulate that experience while enjoying good food and drinks, have I got the restaurant for you.

                    Costa Alta Beach Bar is a bar and restaurant located a short distance past the Lanseria Airport, depending on where you are this drive may take a little longer, but it is worth the experience. The restaurant is uniquely themed as a beach bar even though it’s somewhere in the middle of Gauteng. By creating their own emulation of a beach, this restaurant provides the same feeling without having to even leave the province.

                    Now the vibe and theme provide a great place to relax and chill out with family and friends, but that is not all that they have to offer. During the afternoons there is live music being played by talented musicians and singers that really are a pleasure to listen to and further accentuate the chilled vibes a beach bar should have to offer.

                    In terms of food, Costa Alta shines. The menu is primarily Mozambique themed with classics such as beef or chicken Prego’s, flame grilled peri-peri chicken, and even prawns cooked to perfection. If this isn’t your style, the menu offers other things such as burgers, pizzas, and platters. The platters are what I would recommend if you are going as a large group, with a choice between classic braaied meats or a seafood platter with enough variety for everyone to be satisfied. The portions are generous, and you are definitely getting your money’s worth here.

                    It being a bar, they do have a selection of drinks available too. Sink your feet into the sand and order a fishbowl for yourself or even a jug for a table, enjoying the sunset overlooking the nearby dam with a variety of tropical island inspired drinks. However, if you don’t drink alcohol, they do have a variety of non-alcoholic versions of these cocktails too for everyone to enjoy.

                    If you want to experience the feeling of visiting the beach without having to even leave the province, ‘Costa Alta Beach Bar’ is the place for you. Come here with your friends or your family and enjoy everything it has to offer. Word of warning though, the place is only open on weekends so I suggest you make a booking in advance to ensure you have a spot waiting and ready for you!
