                Review: A Streetbar named Desire!
            </h1>
            <article class="Blog">
                <p>
                    Recently me and my friends went out for drinks at a place called “A Streetbar named Desire”. A play on words from the play “A Streetcar named Desire”, this bar is really vibey and has a great atmosphere to wind down and spend with some friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bar is located on Jan Smuts Ave at the popular Park Corner nearby the Rosebank Mall. When you go, you have a choice of two seating arrangements, an indoor bar or outside on their terrace. We booked a table on the terrace and had a view of the surrounding area, including the many art galleries across the road. As the sun sets you really begin to enjoy the atmosphere with music playing in the background and people enjoying themselves. Staff are friendly and professional, with excellent service. The establishment also follows social distance guidelines well so there’s nothing to worry about on that end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now for the important part, the food, and because it’s a bar, the drinks! This bar serves tapas (small, sharable dishes) with a middle eastern influence. If that is not your style, you can also order from a separate Mexican menu from another restaurant that shares their kitchen. The food is delicious from both sides, but I recommend ordering some nachos to share as some portion sizes can be small. The menus also have many vegetarian options, so no one is left out. I had the Harissa marinated sirloin with lemon and roasted pepper chimichurri, and I can recommend this to anyone who decides to come here.

                    This bar shines however with its drinks. You can order whatever you want from wines, beers or even some rum and Coke, but personally it’s the cocktails that shine. There are approximately 20 cocktails served (with virgin options for most) that range from classics like a Negroni to ones called ‘Epic Fornications’. I ordered the Sour Cherry Mojito which was quite refreshing and a nice take on a classic Mojito.

                    It will set you back a bit with the food costing approximately R100 on average per person, with additional costs depending on how much you drink. Normal drinks (alcoholic) will be around R40-R50 on average, and cocktails ranging around R80 on average.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While sipping on a cocktail and enjoying the ambience and conversations, ‘A Streetbar named Desire’ is the perfect place to meet up with friends to catch up, or even for after work drinks with your colleagues, and I recommend you try it out at least once!
