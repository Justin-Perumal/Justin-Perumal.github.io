                <p>
                    Recently it was a family members birthday so to celebrate we decided to go eat out at a restaurant. However, we wanted to try somewhere new that we haven’t visited before. This led to the decision of visiting Donatellas! Donatellas is a restaurant that can be found at Monte Casino in Fourways. I’ve passed by this restaurant multiple times whenever I was at Monte, but never actually sat down and ate there. This birthday celebration would be a perfect reason for all of us to go out (while being safe of course) and enjoy this new experience together.

                <p>
                    So, what does Donatellas have to offer? Well, Donatella’s is labelled as a contemporary Italian restaurant with delicious Mediterranean and Italian cuisine, and I must say that it delivers on that. The restaurant specialises in these cuisines but is not limited to only those flavours which I will elaborate on later. The restaurant itself is both comfortable to dine in and is well styled and designed, with a possibility of ‘indoor-outdoor’ dining (sit outside of the restaurant being able to mimic sitting outdoors, matches well with the theming of Monte Casino itself). The restaurant has multiple seating locations both outside and in with separate smoking sections for those who need it or private areas for functions and larger groups.

                    Now let’s talk about the most important part of any restaurant, the food. As I said before, the restaurant specialises in Mediterranean and Italian cuisine with all the things you would associate with those: pizza, pasta, a wide variety of seafood, and different grilled meats. However, they do not limit themselves to a box and also create dishes not traditionally Italian while adding that Italian flare. For example, one of their specialty dishes is a fillet of kudu (when available), this adds a South African flare to their dish and allows people to try this type of meat with the assurance that it will be expertly prepared.

                    Another one of their specialty dishes, which I ordered, is the “Paella Donatellas”. This is a dish that originated from Spain which primarily consists of rice cooked in a flavourful broth where the rice would absorb the entirety of the liquid once being perfectly cooked, this in combination with a variety of meats, seafood and spices ensure that a paella is extremely flavourful and satisfying. The paella at Donatellas delivers on this, but drifts slightly from tradition so they can add their own twists. I recommend this dish if you want to visit.

                    In terms of pricing, it is a little on the expensive side, but it is worth the price you pay. I recommend coming here for a special occasion or even just a lunch to spoil yourself. The staff are friendly, and the service is great! I will definitely be returning to try even more at some point, maybe I’ll see you guys there too!
