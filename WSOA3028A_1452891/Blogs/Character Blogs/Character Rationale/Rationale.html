                        Description and Rationale of character created
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        The character I have created for this blogsite is named Jake Dresden. The blogs are written using words and thoughts, but to create this persona, they are also written from this characterâ€™s perspective. I created this character using a blend of my personal interests and past experiences. This character is created as part of an assignment for my web development course.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jake Dresden is a 23-year-old chef who has some interest in development and is based in Johannesburg, South Africa. Before becoming a professionally trained chef, Jake studied Computer Science in university before dropping out and going to culinary school. This is based on previous interests in development before realising cooking was his passion.

                    <p>
                        This character is a blend of my own personal interests and taking inspiration from my own personal history. Being a chef is generally far off from being a developer. Therefore, I used my own history of studying computer science before I changed to game design as a basis. That coupled with my interest in cooking created the foundation for the character.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The background in Computer Science is where I blend his profession with the theoretical sections found on the site. I am using this to keep the theoretical sections as more of a discussion on topics or readings, while still showcasing the appropriate level of engagement with the theoretical components.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because of my interest in cooking, I made Jake a trained chef to create more varied blogs that do not relate explicitly to development and the web. This also allows me to create blogs showcasing local restaurants (especially now during Covid-19), recipes (found online and ones I create myself), and even new technology in the culinary world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By basing the character from my own personal experience and interests, it makes it easier to make content from the characters perspective, as there is that loose connection between myself and the character. This allows me to make blogs that I myself would potentially upload, without having the personal attachment.

                        This character was designed mainly through the use of this <a href="./reedsy-character-profile-template filled.pdf" target="_blank">character stylesheet!</a>
