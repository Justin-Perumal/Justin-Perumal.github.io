                        Blog 1: A reflection on readings by Jorge Luis Borges and their relation to the web!
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        Recently I have read two interesting pieces of literature called the “Garden of Forking Paths” and “The Library of Babel”, both written by Jorge Luis Borges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the Library of Babel, Borges discusses a universe made up entirely of hexagonal rooms or libraries that seem to be infinite. The special thing about these infinite libraries are the books contained within. Each book is unique, and no book is the same throughout the infinite amount, however the differences between one book and the next could just be a change in one singular letter or even a differing punctuation point.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By combining these infinite libraries and unique books it allows every possible sequence or combination between every character (punctuation marks, letters, numbers etc.). This means that these libraries potentially contain every form of text that has ever been written and every text that has yet to be written.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Garden of Forking Paths is a story about German Spy, Yu Tsun, infiltrating England during WWII whose cover had been blown. In order to relay the information he found to his captain, Yu travels to a town called Ashgrove and is guided to the home of a Dr. Stephen Albert. Dr. Albert has studied a novel created by Ts’ui Pen, who Yu is coincidentally the descendant of, which is seen to be an elaborate maze in which ‘men lose themselves’. This labyrinth is called the “Garden of Forking Paths”, what makes it special is how choice is given. Most books are in chronological order and a character makes a choice and progresses. In this the character makes all choices at the same time which splits the story accordingly amongst the choices creating varying timelines. Dr. Albert relates this to the current encounter stating there are different timelines where they may be friends or even enemies. Yu then shoots the Dr when he is turned away and is caught soon after, but his message has reached his captain.

                    <p>
                        The Garden of Forking Paths alludes to how the choices we make can lead to different outcomes or even how choices made before changes our current circumstances. This means that there are an infinite number of outcomes and situations we can be seen in depending on how each choice plays out. This is like a choose your own adventure style game with varying endings depending on the choices made.

                    <p>
                        By taking both pieces into account, I thought of similarities between their core ideas and what we know as the internet today. The Library of Babel contains all possibilities and all information like how with the internet we access an almost infinite amount of information (considering expansion of knowledge in the future). With the Garden of Forking Paths, the timelines continuously split into what seems to be a web. Just like the World Wide Web with branching pieces of information which are interconnected in some way with an infinite number of possibilities

                        I hope you guys enjoyed my first blog, I read these and just had to write something about them. I will be updating even more blogs in the future and I hope you look forward to them.
