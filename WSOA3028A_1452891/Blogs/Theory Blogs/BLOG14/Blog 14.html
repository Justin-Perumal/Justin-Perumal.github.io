                    <h1> API and my implementation!</h1>
                    <p>
                        Hey everybody! Today I am going to be talking about something that is quite exciting and really cool, especially when it comes to web development. Some of you may have noticed that in my restaurant review blogs, there is a new addition that can be found at the bottom of each one. This new addition is an extract from google maps showing the actual address of these restaurants, allowing you guys to see exactly where it is if you want to check the place out for yourselves. This is a fully functional map that is directly from Google Maps. I could have easily taken a screenshot of the map or just left the address for you guys to find it on your own, but I think this not only makes it easier, but is also just a great way to showcase what is possible when it comes to what you can put on a website!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, how does this work? How am I getting a direct map from Google and placing it inside my website? It is much easier than you would think. By using something called an Application Programming Interface (API), which is a type of software liaison that allows applications to communicate with one another. This communication allows certain things to happen between these two applications (such as displaying the map on my site). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just so it is easier to understand, let’s have a real-life example of what an API is. You and a few friends go to a restaurant and sit at a table. You know what you want to order, and the kitchen will now prepare it for you. The only thing is, how are you going to get your order to the kitchen. That’s where a waiter would come in and communicate your order to the kitchen, who will send back the correct dish for you to enjoy. In this example, you and the kitchen are the two applications, and the waiter is the API. The waiter will act as a liaison of communication between you and the kitchen ensuring that the correct information is given, and the correct output or product is received. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now that you know what an API is, let me explain the API I have used, and why I chose to use that one in particular. The API that I have used is from the ‘Google Maps Platform’ and is specifically the ‘Maps JavaScript API’. This API allows me to pull a specific point from the Google Maps server and display it accordingly on my own site. By giving it a specific set of coordinates (latitude and longitude), the map will now show the exact location I want. I can control the zoom and certain details that would be shown and thus provide a visual reference of location. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I chose this API as when it comes to restaurants, it is all good and well to know the food, service, vibes, and overall feel of the restaurant. Sometimes however, you find that the restaurant is just too far away for you to realistically go and try it for yourself or that it is in a small area that the directions slightly miss out on. By providing the exact location geographically on the map, you can gauge the general area and thus estimate travel times, traffic levels, and even whether it is in a small hidey hole area or not among other things.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using APIs, the possibilities are seemingly endless. I could have expanded upon my map for example, allowing you to get directions from your location to the restaurant in question. However, I decided against that as it is not the focus of what I want to provide and at the same time I do not want unnecessary access to your location. I provide the review and address, with the overall general location. Then it is up to you to go to your directional app of choice and carry on as that is their purpose, while my site’s purpose is for me to share my thoughts and opinions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There was other APIs I thought of implementing, one for example would calculate the nutritional information of ingredients which would work well with my recipes, but I still do not know enough about APIs and did not want to implement something without fully understanding it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope this one was a little enlightening and gave you a small insight into how this site was designed, and perhaps taught you something if you are interested in creating your own.
