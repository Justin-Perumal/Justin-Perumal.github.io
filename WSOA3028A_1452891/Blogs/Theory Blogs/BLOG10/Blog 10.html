                    <h1> Ethical Implementation of UX/UI </h1>
                    <p>
                        Hey everybody! Welcome back to another blog! Today’s topic is going to be related to a few things I have touched upon in the past, namely usability, user experience (UX), and user interface (UI). However, unlike before where I discussed the importance of these things. In this blog I want to discuss the ethical issues that surround these that are dependent on how they are implemented on any site, including my own. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now you may be asking how UI and UX are related to ethics. When the proposed UX is designed, the designers are essentially trying to get into the minds of their users to provide them with a better experience which leads to their product (for example, in my case this website) being successful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now depending on how the UX and UI is designed, a user may feel coerced into doing something that was either not their main purpose or unknowingly provide information that was not necessary at all. You see this type of thing all the time on many different sites. Some sites will allow you to purchase something, but then add extra items to your cart or attempt to coerce you into purchasing things you do not need. Other sites may try and get your information when it is completely unnecessary, such as news sites that require you to login with certain personal details just to view a single article (where they would use this information to sell their own products or use it through driven advertising). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This manipulation of user agency is one of the core ethical issue surrounding implementation of UX and UI. An example of this would be by minimising the decisions a user can make. This would essentially bottleneck a user down a specific path that leads to something the designer wanted to get out of them. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are many ethical issues surrounding the implementation of UI and UX and it is important to understand it from both a designer and user perspective. A user would want to ensure that their data is safe and that the site is not trying to manipulate them in any way. A designer should strive to ensure the users demands are met and that their product is successful. However, these are not black and white and there will always be a grey area when it comes down to it. The users shouldn’t be manipulated, but a product must be successful in some way. This in turn means each case would have to looked at through its own lens for a conclusive decision to be made.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I could go on about these issues and how to go about them, but that would keep us here for a while. I have been trying to ensure that my site has been designed well with my userbase and ethics in mind.

With that being said, I will see you guys in the next blog
