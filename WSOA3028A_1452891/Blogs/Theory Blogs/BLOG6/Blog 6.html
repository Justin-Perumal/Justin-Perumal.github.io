                    <h1> Blog 6: Norman doors? How does this relate to web design? </h1>
                    <p>
                        Hey everyone! Today‚Äôs blog post will cover a little bit more of a technical subject. It relates to how things should be designed to be more usable or provide a better user experience. This idea came from a video I watched based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY96hTb8WgI">‚ÄòNorman doors‚Äô</a>, these doors are the ones you‚Äôll see everywhere that are designed so badly you never get them right (I‚Äôm always pulling that push door). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Don Norman (who the Norman doors are named after) is the author of a book called ‚ÄúThe design of everyday things‚Äù. In this book he states that these doors are related to two principles of design, namely ‚Äòdiscoverability‚Äô and ‚Äòfeedback‚Äô. Discoverability is the process learning what is possible and what can be done to an object, while feedback is the response or reaction an object showcases when an external action is placed on it. These two principles combined form the basis of what‚Äôs commonly known as human-centered design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Human-centered design is a way of designing with the wants and needs of the user being the focus and forefront of all major design decisions. This includes designers putting themselves in the users‚Äô shoes to truly understand the users wants/needs. This way of designing things is generally done through many iterations, that are tested and redesigned continuously, until something comes about that fulfils all the users‚Äô requirements while never being a hindrance (potentially being even a pleasure to use). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After learning about Norman doors and this method of designing it made me think of how it could be related to a websites design and its user experience (UX). It made me think of the design decisions I have made for this website and whether it follows the human-centered philosophy. Just like all the doors that have been designed poorly, there are many websites around that can be considered the online equivalent of a Norman door and I don‚Äôt want mine to be one of those. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you use a website, it shouldn‚Äôt be confusing on where to go or what to do. The information should be presented in such a way that you intuitively know what‚Äôs available to you and what you can potentially do on the site. This can only be achieved with a lot of testing of both the overall design and the UX, making the necessary adjustments along the way. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the end of the day, I‚Äôve tried to design this site to the best I can while trying to ensure you guys, the readers (my users), have the best possible experience from both my content and my design decisions. I‚Äôm going to keep on trying and design this site with even more emphasis on human-centered design and hopefully we never reach the Norman door phase. Anyway, I hope you‚Äôve enjoyed this blog and I‚Äôll see you in the next one! üòä
