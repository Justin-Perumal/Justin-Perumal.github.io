                    <h1> Blog 4: The Medium is the Message and its impact on how we understand the web </h1>
                    <p>
                        Hey everyone! Were back with another blog that relates something I have read upon recently. Today‚Äôs topic is ‚ÄúThe Medium is the Message‚Äù by Marshal McLuhan and I want to take that further and say how his book impacts how we understand the world wide web.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, what does the ‚ÄòMedium is the Message‚Äô mean? McLuhan argued that the message (what is being communicated) is less important than the medium the message was sent through. In other words, the way information is sent and received is more important than the information itself. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The idea behind this statement was that the medium information was presented in had a far larger affect on society than the information itself. For example, in the past before books or printed media when the main way of communication was through speech. This medium of communication relied almost entirely on the auditory senses. Unlike books and printed media that relies heavily on visuals. McLuhan theorised that this change in the mediums technology also affected how society progresses, and this change can even be seen today with the current environment of the internet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Touching on how McLuhan believed the medium affects society, the cell phone is a prime example of this. Cell phones changed the way many people in society think and act especially in social settings. Not only did it change the way we perceive and send information, but things like fashion and urban planning had to change as well to accommodate this new medium. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the internet and the world wide web, we have access to not only a vast array of information, but also to one another. With a simple tap of a button, you can receive information from halfway across the world in mere seconds, but this is only achieved because of the medium that is the internet. A direct comparison could be conversations you have in person which could create thoughts or ideas. These ideas will take time to form a solid basis and spread because of its medium. However, the same ideas and opinions can be formed much quicker through the internet due to its nature and how we perceive the information shown to us, further supporting the idea that the medium is more important. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With an advancement of technology, the medium creates a drastic change in the ideas we form from the information provided. The message provides information for how we interact with our surroundings, while the medium changes the scale of that interaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This topic can go extremely in depth and I recommend researching it some more if you are interested. There‚Äôs only so much I can discuss in these short blogs. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OseOb_wBsi4">Youtube video</a> is a nice start, it briefly goes over the ideas and provides a few examples. One last thing I thought was funny when I was reading up on McLuhan‚Äôs book. There was an error during the editorial process and his book was misspelled as the ‚ÄúMedium is Massage‚Äù. McLuhan liked this mistake and decided to keep it, some believe as a metaphor for the ideas in the book, but I think he just thought it was funny. I hope you enjoyed, and I‚Äôll see you in the next blog üòä.
