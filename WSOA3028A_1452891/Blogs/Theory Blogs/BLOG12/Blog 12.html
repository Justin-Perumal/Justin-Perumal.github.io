                    <h1> Fama.io and its ethical issues</h1>
                    <p>
                        Hey hey hey, were back with another blog! Recently I came across something that is quite interesting and may affect a lot of us even if we don’t know about it. This thing is called <a href="https://fama.io/">‘Fama.io’</a> which is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based service that provides background checks for companies when they are hiring people. The service provided will make an AI go through a candidate’s social media profiles and provide information to the employer. This information will weed out any things that could be seen as red flags will notify the employer and at times may completely influence their decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now this service has a lot of benefits to employers, especially in today’s day and age. With many people being put under fire with things they have said or done in the past (mainly found out through social media), it would be nice to know beforehand if the person you’re hiring has done anything similar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, the process of digging into people’s personal lives and information does not sit right with many people. People are generally different when they are not in a professional setting. With their own interests, hobbies, opinions, and outlooks. Many people use social media to display these things to the world and share their own experiences. Granted this information is readily available when a user makes a post for the employer to view, but with the screening being done by an AI, it is entirely possible for false outcomes to occur. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the screening is done using an AI whose criteria is set up by the company using the service, it is possible that it will make a mistake. AI must go through multiple phases of reinforced learning of patterns and data. This means that the AI must be able to adapt accordingly to any person’s social media for it to give clear and concise results for every screening it does. Should the AI misinterpret a specific post or even flag something that wasn’t clear to begin with. The AI would have provided the employer with false information and the potential employee would now be at a disadvantage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This specific AI service is used in isolated circumstances when a company is hiring. However, what if it wasn’t? What if this AI was used to scour the internet at any given time and acquire any personal information from any user’s social media? This would be a huge problem as we would not know where that data is going, we might not even know it happens in the first place. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my opinion it does it have it merit depending on where it gets the information. Platforms such as LinkedIn, which are made for professional use, would be the perfect place for this AI while things such as Twitter should be less of a focus. These are just my two cents on the topic, if you want to read more, check <a href="https://idzyns.com/the-ethics-of-social-media-background-checks/">this</a> out. I am curious as to what you guys think. Thanks again for reading my blogs and I will see you guys later!
