                    <h1> Blog 5: The Importance of Accessibility </h1>
                    <p>
                        Hey Everyone, Jake here and welcome back to my blog posts and if this happens to be the first one you read, welcome! In this blog I want to discuss something that hits close to home, and this is the importance of accessibility, specifically with online media and the internet. This topic is important to me personally as I have family who are visually impaired. However, many sites are designed with no way for assistive tools to be used effectively or at all. An example of these includes sites designed without using Semantic Markup (which I briefly discussed a while ago) or websites designed with overly complex layouts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What is web accessibility? Web accessibility is essentially websites, and the tools and technologies related, being designed in such a way that people with disabilities (physical or mental) can use them. More specifically it allows people to navigate and interact with the web or contribute to it in some form.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now why is accessibility important other than allowing everyone to access and use the internet and its many websites. Many people use the internet because of the tools available. These tools allow people to do things in a simpler and sometimes more effective way. These can include managing bank accounts, access to social activities online, and even online shopping. Every person has the right to equally access these tools, yet majority of designers overlook this aspect or flat out ignore it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The importance for accessibility is even more important in our current times given the current state of the world. With majority of the world still applying social distancing and lockdown rules, accessibility has never been more important. Being able to use the internet is crucial for everyone. Itâ€™s now needed for seeing loved ones you canâ€™t see in person, or even just buying simple groceries without having to leave your home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Without even taking into consideration the moral aspects of why accessibility is important, there is a big reason why it is extremely important for businesses. If their website is inaccessible to others, those people will simply go to another site that does accommodate them, therefore losing that business a potential customer. Not only this but businesses have a legal obligation to provide equal access to their site to all. Should they fail to comply, they are viable expensive lawsuits with expensive fines or penalties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After reading this I hope you understand why accessibility is important, even if you are not developing a website of your own. If you would like to read further, the World Wide Web Consortium has a lot of articles on accessibility and go through various <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/">Accessibility Fundamentals</a> under their â€˜Web Accessibility Initiativeâ€™. I hope you enjoyed and have learnt something new or have a new outlook on accessibility, hope to see you in the next blog! ðŸ˜Š
