                    <p>
                        Hi everyone! Its Jake here with another blog post. I hope you enjoyed the last one and I am here again to discuss a topic I have recently been interested in. Today I want to talk about User Generated Content and how it can be a good or a bad thing. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For some backstory, I have been posting on my Instagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/jdrescooks/">@JDresCooks</a>) and I noticed some comments asking me for the specifics on the equipment I used. After this, I decided to make a whole post dedicated to showcasing each piece so that people could potentially acquire one for themselves. However, one comment stood out. The comment was about how I should ask for a sponsor because I was basically giving free advertising to these brands. This led to me learning more about content made by users and I would like to share my thoughts and what I have found.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, what is User Generated Content (UGC). UGC is essentially content (reviews, images, videos etc.) created by the users of a brand rather than by the brand itself. The brands generally repost this content on their own social media accounts. This is generally seen as free advertising as the brand showcases that its users are either happy with the product or service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now how does this affect branding and the general users of these brands. Unlike in the past where most products would be marketed by a team of professionals, brands are relying more on the word of mouth and content created for them. UGC also has a potentially long-lasting positive effect through garnering brand loyalty as UGC is seen as more authentic and sometimes personal than what is generally created by marketers. However, the most important thing coming from UGC is how it creates a community around the brand. People naturally move towards being apart of something and UGC allows both the brand and the users to come together and create a space for all to enjoy. An example of this would be videogames whose UGC has created countless communities who try to get even more players to join and thus spreading the brand even further than before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        UGC however, is not always a good thing. If someone was not very fond of the product or found some flaw in either the brand or the people behind it, UGC can be potentially weaponised against the brand causing it to inevitably fail. Even UGC that is not inherently negative can have a negative effect on branding, this can come from the actual users who create the content. If the user themselves has been found to do something wrong or does not have a high standing with others, their content may negatively impact the brands just through association.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is just the tip of the iceberg that is UGC and is just a brief overview from what I have read and researched. If you are interested, I suggest researching more on your own, perhaps start with this article <a href="https://stackla.com/resources/blog/what-is-user-generated-content-the-ultimate-guide-to-ugc-marketing/">here</a> which I found does a good job of explaining. After all this, I might go for that sponsor after all ðŸ˜Š.
