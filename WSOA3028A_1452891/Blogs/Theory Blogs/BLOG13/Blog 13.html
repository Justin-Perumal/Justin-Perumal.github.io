                    <h1> Reflection on Implicit Bias Test.</h1>
                    <p>
                        Hello everybody! Recently I took a test that measures a person’s implicit bias when given certain information. If you don’t know what an implicit bias is, it’s essentially an unconscious association; belief; or attitude toward a particular group of people or any other social group. This leads to stereotyping of certain groups based on these implicit biases. I thought I would share my results as it is a huge talking point, especially in today’s age where implicit biases have a huge effect on how we see people, and how it could potentially impact someone. If you are interested in taking the test for yourself, you can do so <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/">here</a>.

                        So, I took two tests just to get a broader understanding of what the test seeks to do. The first was an Evaluative Priming Task (EPT) in which the test would examine people’s evaluations of others who behave differently than what is stereotypically common to their gender. This test I was given two different people, one who was typical to their gender and one who was atypical. The data suggests that I have no preference between the two, while the study states that generally those who acted atypically would be negatively stereotyped and associated regardless.

                        The second test I took was the Implicit Association Test (IAT) in which the test would examine the automatic association or strength of it between concepts such as ‘men’, ‘not-men’, and a person’s sexual attraction (or lack thereof) to these concepts. In this test, I was given multiple images of random things in conjunction with a bunch of half-naked men (who were all conventionally attractive) and was instructed to separate these images into categories such as “Men”, “Sexually attracted”, “Not-Men”, and “Not Sexually attracted”. These categories would sometimes be paired together, and the test would examine how fast you correctly categorised things. My results suggests that there is no difference in my automatic sexual attraction to ‘men’ or ‘not-men’.

                    <p>
                        I am no expert, so I have no idea what the results mean and whether they are completely conclusive or not. However, I do understand what an implicit bias is and how something like it could affect people, especially in specific fields like software development for example. Firstly, by having an implicit bias (and by extension various stereotypes) certain people may unfairly judge a piece of software or a developer’s capabilities purely from these biases. Instead of being completely objective about something, a bias may introduce that little but of subjectivity that completely alters a person’s viewpoint. This is not something that can be fixed easily unfortunately and requires a fair amount of work to rectify.

                        I thought this would be an interesting topic to talk about and perhaps through seeing my results, you guys may understand me a little bit better. As always if you want to have a discussion, my DMs are open. Let me know how you guys do if you take the test and I will see you guys in the next blog!
