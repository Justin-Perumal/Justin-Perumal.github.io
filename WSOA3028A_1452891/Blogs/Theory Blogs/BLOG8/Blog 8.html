                    <h1> Blog 8: The Digital Divide! </h1>
                    <p>
                        Hey everybody! Recently I read an interesting <a href="http://www.ngopulse.org/article/2020/08/28/levels-digital-divide-south-africa">article</a> talking about the “Levels of Digital Divide in South Africa”, which elaborates on how the Digital Divide creates inequality and opportunity between those who do not have access to technology and those who do. I highly recommend reading it. So, I wanted to hop onto this topic and talk about it from my point of view and understanding and why it is an important issue that needs discussion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you don’t know what the Digital Divide is, it is the gap that exists between people who have access to communication and information technologies (such as the internet) and those who do not. This can also be equated to the ‘Digital inequality’ created from many different factors such as geographic location, economic status, education, and even the quality of the technologies available. Some of these factors can be explained further to ensure you have a proper understanding how they further the divide between people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In terms of geographic location, more economically developed countries (generally found in the northern parts of the world) have not only a better quality of technologies but also the infrastructure that supports this. In poorer, underdeveloped regions; this infrastructure is not available. Therefore, the people living in these regions inherently have significantly worse access to these technologies. This is an example of the global Digital Divide. This geographic inequality can even be seen when zoomed into these regions themselves. More developed areas or suburbs will have much better access than rural areas and this creates a Digital Divide on a local level. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Considering how certain countries have better infrastructure and access, this can also lead to a difference in digital literacy between people. In more developed countries it is easier to learn how to use these digital technologies with computers and devices readily available, but also children are taught how to use these at a young age in school and in most cases at home. In developing countries, there is a huge lack of physical computers and devices available that make the gap larger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These are just some of the factors that cause the Digital Divide, but it is a very complex topic with a lot of factors and nuances that can’t be summarised in a few paragraphs. If you would like to know more, please check this <a href="http://www.digitaldividecouncil.com/what-is-the-digital-divide/">article</a> out as they go into much more detail than I could.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now why is the Digital Divide important and why should we be discussing it? Well firstly, the clear imbalance of access promotes that those at the lower end have fewer opportunities available to them. This creates a cycle that those with access continuously further themselves and gain access to even more opportunities, while the others reach a point of stagnation where they repeat the cycle once more (especially in areas of poverty). Also considering how internet access has been deemed as a human right, this divide can be seen as an infringement on these rights.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Not even taking into account the socio-economic problems that arise from this, let’s look at it with the current situation the world is facing. Being in a pandemic, access to the internet and its technologies have never been more important. With most things going online, it has never been more apparent that there is a severe inequality of access. This has not only caused issues for people on a social level keeping in touch with each other, but has also prevented many people from acquiring necessary information related to the pandemic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I know this a slight change from the usual topics I cover in my blogs, but this is an important issue that people need to know about. I hope this was a little bit educational and that it leaves you thinking a bit more on the Digital divide and its impact around the world. If you want to discuss it further, please hit me up on my socials and let’s have a conversation. Anyway, thank you for reading my blogs and I’ll see you guys in the next one!
