                    <h1> Blog 7: Usability on the internet! </h1>
                    <p>
                        Hey hey hey everyone, were back with another blog! If you haven’t already checked them out, a few of my past blogs touched upon the topics of how import accessibility is on the web and how websites should be designed to accommodate its users. Today I am going to talk about a topic that is related to these and just further builds upon the ideas presented, this is usability on the web.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What is usability? Well, usability refers to how easily something can be used to achieve a particular goal or interaction while being efficient, and/or being satisfactory. When it comes to the usability of website however, usability is how ‘user-friendly’ the website is by how easily a user can interact with the site to fulfil its intended purpose. Usability is linked to a sites ‘User Interface’ (UI) and its User ‘Experience’ (UX) which work together to provide the satisfaction needed for a user. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How do those three concepts work together? Well, UI refers to a websites visual appearance and facilitates the interaction between the user and the website, and UX refers to the overall experience and quality of interaction a user has with the website while navigating/using what’s available. So therefore, if a website has a well-designed interface, it allows the website to be used far more effectively and would then all the user to have a positive user experience.

                    <p>
                        Now let’s go a little bit deeper on usability and briefly discuss some of its key elements: 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Clear Navigation”: This is essentially referring to how a user will explore a website, from scrolling around, visiting different pages, and even interacting with the different elements on the site. A website that has good usability should be navigated intuitively, allowing the user to achieve what they wanted (and for the designer to give what they intended) in the fewest/easiest steps possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Performance”: This element is essentially how fast the website loads, or how fast is the content available to the user. This one is very important as if the website takes a long time to load in people will not waste any time and will leave, potentially never coming back indicating poor usability and a negative user experience. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        “Responsiveness”: Responsiveness is how well a website will function and appear on different devices and screen sizes, this is especially important considering how many devices are available today (smartphones, tablets, desktops, or even some fridges). If the website cannot handle being displayed on certain devices, those users who have no other means will just not be able to use the site at all and will probably never come back.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Usability is not something that just happens overnight and remains constant. It is always adapting and changing to accommodate people and can only truly be done through multiple iterations of trial and error. I haven’t even scratched the surface on it, but if you would like to learn more, you can check out this <a href="https://21designs.com.au/learn/designer-tips/what-is-usability-in-web-design/">article on usability</a> as a start. I hope you guys enjoyed and have maybe learnt something new, I’ll see you guys in the next blog! 😊
