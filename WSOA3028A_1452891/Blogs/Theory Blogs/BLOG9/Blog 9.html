                    <h1> Study of Information Geographies </h1>
                    <p>
                        Hey everyone! Today’s blog is going to be a little bit different than the usual stuff I do. Recently I have went through a reading named “Toward a study of information geographies” which revolved around how information has a geography, and I would like to discuss it as best I can. The core behind the reading is information (which in this case is the internet and all it has available) is reliant on its geographic location as these locations have different infrastructures, technologies, and networks which each have a physical form. Due to this difference in infrastructure or technology, it is made clear that not every place in the world has equal access to information. This reading uses a variety of statistics and data to showcase this inequality and I will be discussing a few of these in detail.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the first measures that can be found is called “geographies of access and enablement”. This investigates who has access to the technology that allows them to access the information in the first place. When looking at the results and statistics shown, it is abundantly clear which areas of the world have the necessary infrastructure available to them. Countries found in the northern parts of the world, specifically in North America and Asia, have the highest percentage of internet users compared to their total population, whereas countries found in the southern parts of the world (Africa in particular) have a low percentage of internet users compared to the population. Keeping this in mind, the reading then goes to show the average cost of internet access and the data correlates to the internet population. In areas with fewer internet users (such as the countries in the south), the average price is significantly higher than that of the areas with a large population of internet users. By comparing the two datasets directly, they are complete inverses of one another. This further illustrates the inequality and shows one of the potential reasons of how your geographic location will influence your access to information.

                        The second measure is called “geographies of participation” which refers to various types of content that is made on the internet every day and how each country contributes to these types of content. The data sets used for this measure are specifically domain names, GitHub users, and Wikipedia edits. When it comes to domain names, again it can be seen that the northern part of the world dominates with almost 93% of domain addresses coming from there, with the areas such as Africa and the Middle East only creating 2%. When it comes to GitHub users, this was used to measure the collaborative software contributions between people and it was found that like before, the northern parts have had most users. This data was then compared to the actual commits (or contributions) and it was found that the commit percentage for countries in the south was lower than that of the user base, indicating that overall the level of contribution was smaller than the others. Finally, Wikipedia edits were used as a measure, and to no one’s surprise, the countries in the south had extremely less edits than compared to those countries in the north. By looking at all the datasets and comparing them to one another, you may notice a pattern forming. When it comes to participation and contribution of the web, the northern countries outnumber those countries found in the south, further extending the gap of inequality for information

                        The third measure, called “geographies of representation”, is all about how these geographic locations are represented in geographically, essentially who content is created for and who is the content made by. For this, there are three datasets that are used, these are Google search results, OpenStreetMap, and Freebase and Geonames. By using Google search results of each countries name, data was acquired about which country was searched the most compared to its internet population. The data found does not correlate completely to a specific country as countries like USA or China had much more results when compared to their internet population. OpenStreetMap was then used to measure the geographical nodes that were present in each country. There is not much of importance here as most of the data correlates to the actual population density, however it is good to note that the actual mapping does have a higher level of activity in countries like USA or in areas that the US has economic or military interest in. Finally, Freebase and Geonames were used to acquire data, both of which are important databases related to the semantic web. Both were used independently to gather data however they were combined in comparison to fully show the results. In general, both had similar outcomes with both showing that North America and Europe have had the most activity. This outcome, as well as all the others discussed, showcase those countries found in the north have an extremely high level of representation when it comes to the internet.

                        With the core data summarised and showcased allow me to give my opinion on this reading by referring to the three main measures used. When looking at all three of the measures, it is clear to see that access to information provided on the web is not equal and is highly dependent on a person’s geographic location. In all three we can see that all data skews towards countries in the north while those in the south continue to be left behind. It is not something that can be fixed overnight however, as it will take an immense amount of effort and resources to even attempt to minimise the gap found. Hopefully one day though, we may get closer.
