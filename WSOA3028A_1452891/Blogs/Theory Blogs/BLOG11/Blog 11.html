                    <h1> Critical Analysis of my own UX and UI</h1>
                    <p>
                        Hey everybody, welcome back to yet another blog! Considering what I have discussed recently about the ethics of UX and UI implementation, as well as multiple blogs on the importance of usability when it comes to UX and UI. A friend suggested that I use that information and essentially analyse my own site to see where it is successful and where it may improve. After looking at it myself, I thought it would be interesting to share my thoughts with you all and if you think otherwise or just want to share your own feedback, just send me a message, I’d appreciate it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before I talk about my own UX and UI, you should know what type of site I wanted to create and why I have designed as I have. I have always enjoyed a minimalist aesthetic when it came to websites and think that less is more when it comes to what you showcase. Due to this I have made it so that only the necessary information is shown to the user where I can and that the blogs I create are easily accessible. This can be seen with each section, whether it be my recipes; restaurant reviews; or even the more technical blogs, each having their own section and place allowing for users to go and read exactly what they want to. This is easily accessed through the navigation bar. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is hard to analyse something you have been designing yourself as you know all the bits and pieces that make it work. However, as I went through my site, I personally believe that the overall usability is quite good. Considering my website is used for blogs and other articles. It is quite easy to navigate around the different sections and specific posts. With each page having the information being centralised with most other space being kept open; it allows for users to focus mainly on what is right in front of them and truly take in the information without distraction. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The overall UX is pleasant but can be improved greatly. The site is not a hindrance to use and overall provides a relatively decent experience. However, this experience can be greatly improved upon as I further develop my skills in web design and learn more about how websites should be designed. I think the biggest improvement I can think of at this time that will improve my UX would be the actual responsiveness of my site, allowing full and functional use on many different devices, and potentially fine tuning its display to make the reading experience more pleasurable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, there you have it. A small and brief analysis the site I have designed. Granted I can’t truly understand its UX completely due to understanding its underlying systems, so I urge you guys to send me message to see where I can improve it. Thanks again for reading interacting with my site and all it has to offer. I will see you guys in the next one!
