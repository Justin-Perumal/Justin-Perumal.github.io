                    <h1> Blog 3: Semantic markup! What is it and why is it important </h1>
                    <p>
                        Hey everyone! I am back with my third blog which is quite an interesting topic regarding how these blogs are created and exactly how I made this website to begin with. I hope you have been enjoying my content so far and look forward to what I have in store as I have so much planned. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyway, back to todays blog topic. Todayâ€™s blog is about something called Semantic markup and why it is necessary for web development. If you are ever interested in making a site of your own, I highly recommend you learn more about it. This all stemmed from this actual site that you are on reading my blogs on right now. As some people may know, most websites are created using a programming language known as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). Now this very website is also created using HTML as its basis and as I learnt HTML, I learnt of something called semantic markup.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Essentially semantic markup is a specific way of writing/programming HTML which reinforces the meaning behind your websites design rather than focusing purely on its appearance. While non-semantic markup leaves you with no meaning behind your HTML code. This means that both will give you the exact same appearance for your site but there is a very important reason why semantic markup is better. Semantic markup is used to structure the content based on its functionality or importance. Semantic markup also clearly dictates the information on a data level for computers and robots (commonly referred to as bots) that are used on the internet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You might be asking what the difference is if it looks the same. It is quite important to use semantic markup because of its structure and the meaning behind the information presented. As I mentioned before, semantic markup provides information to various bots and computers that are on the internet. These bots can use this information to clearly rank the importance of pages on your website to potentially help spread it among related search results. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The information provided also assists with people who may have disabilities of some kind. Using the correct semantic markup allows a clear and concise understanding and is necessary for things such as screen readers to work effectively. Therefore, by using semantic markup, you ensure that your website is accessible by an even wider audience who can consume your content in their own ways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another great example of why semantic markup is a good practice comes with something I have personally come across while making this site. Maintenance is much easier when using semantic markup as everything is clearly defined in its purpose and allows you to quickly go to the exact section you want to change or check on. This makes it much easier especially as your code becomes more complex as the site continues to grow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These are just a few things I have come across and I thought I should share what I have found especially since a lot of people have been asking how to make sites of their own. I recommend reading on this further if you are interested. Maybe even start <a href="https://seekbrevity.com/semantic-markup-important-web-design/#:~:text=Semantic%20markup%20is%20a%20way,content%20rather%20than%20its%20appearance.&text=Writing%20semantic%20markup%20means%20understanding,and%20machines%20will%20read%20it.">here</a> which explains semantic markup in much more detail than I can. Thank you for reading once again, see you in the next one ðŸ˜Š.
