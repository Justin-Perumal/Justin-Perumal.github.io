                    <h1>Bonus Blog 1: Tools I recommend for development</h1>
                    <p>
                        I noticed some traction on this blogsite and since I have been talking about different topics related to web development, I thought I‚Äôd share what I use in developing this site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently this site is hosted on GitHub and not only is it free, but it also provides a variety of services that assist in development. First and foremost, the website is hosted using the GitHub Pages feature, which is linked to your GitHub repositories. For a guide on how to host your page, I recommend following the steps found <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/learn/a-guide-to-using-github-pages/">here</a> This link takes you to a site that will clearly explain the steps needed to create your repository and host it online.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not only is it useful to host your website, using GitHub you have control of your current version before it goes live on the server. GitHub makes sure you are ready to send the current version by showing you different things. This includes the changes you have made, the different files you have added or removed and even changes in the hierarchy of your repository. Should you feel satisfied you can then push these changes to the server which will reflect very quickly. If you are not satisfied with the changes or see that you made a mistake, you can revert to a previous version easily.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now for the actual HTML code, I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> (VSC). This is one of the many Integrated Development Environments (IDE) available which I prefer. VSC not only provides a clear editor and layout that makes coding easier, but there are also multiple plugins available that will help you. Some of the plugins I use specifically for web development are the HTML plugin for VSC which automatically formats code, therefore making the coding experience easier. Another is the ‚ÄúLive Sever‚Äù, which essentially provides you with live feedback of the changes you make (through a  localhost on your web browser) without having to push it to your host or refresh every time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One final tool I think is quite useful is the ‚ÄúChrome Developer Tools‚Äù. This is built into Google Chrome and can be accessed on any site by pressing the ‚ÄòF12‚Äô key. This opens a panel with the current sites HTML code where you can view and even make changes to see how it would affect the site (note, this is only local and once refreshed, the site will return to its previous state). These tools also allow you to view the site on different devices from cell phones to desktops. Chrome Developer Tools also have a variety of other features that I myself am still learning about, so I urge you to explore and learn for yourself as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am no expert in web development, and I am still learning about it as the days go by. So, these are a few of the tools available that I use but by no means are these the only ones, there is a vast array of tools that someone else may prefer. I hope this helped you if you may want to begin making your own sites or did not know where to start. Thank you for reading my content and I hope to see you visit again soon üòä.
