                        Recently I have read two interesting pieces of literature called the “Garden of Forking Paths” and “The Library of Babel”, both written by Jorge Luis Borges.

                        In the Library of Babel, Borges discusses a universe made up entirely of hexagonal rooms or libraries that seem to be infinite. The special thing about these infinite libraries are the books contained within. Each book is unique, and no book is the same throughout the infinite amount, however the differences between one book and the next could just be a change in one singular letter or even a differing punctuation point.
